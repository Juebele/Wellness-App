Full-Snack is  dedicated to revolutionizing the way individuals approach their health and nutrition. By offering a comprehensive meal tracking platform, Full-Snack empowers users to take control of their dietary habits and make informed decisions about their meals.

At Full-Snack, we understand that maintaining a balanced and nutritious diet can be a challenge in today's fast-paced world. Our mission is to simplify the process by providing users with a user-friendly and intuitive platform that seamlessly integrates into their daily routines.


## Our Why

We created this application to practice full-stack web development and demonstrate our knowledge of multiple enterprise-level technologies.
We wanted to include a polished UI, use of multiple API routes, and additional technology that we have not used before.


## How does it work?

This app makes use of advanced Javascript, npm packages, and databases. Our app uses a database to keep track of users, their meal plans, and their workout plans. This data is then populated dynamically using handlebars files to create a page that's unique to each user. All of the API routes are done with a series of .js files that use proper MVC principles to compartmentalize code.

## Dependencies

All required packages are listed in the included package.json file. Simply run "npm install" in the terminal to install all of the required packages.
