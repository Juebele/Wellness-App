# Wellness-App

## What?
    This app allows multiple users to save a meal plan and workout plan and update both as needed. 

## Why?
    We created this application to practice full-stack web development and demonstrate our knowledge of multiple enterprise-level technologies.

    We wanted to include a polished UI, use of multiple API routes, and an additional technology that we hadn't used before. We decided to use Tailwind CSS for the additional formatting options that it provides.


## How does it work?

     This app makes use of advanced Javascript, npm packages, and databases. Our app uses a database to keep track of users, their meal plans, and their workout plans. This data is then populated dynamically using handlebars files to create a page that's unique to each user. All of the API routes are done with a series of .js files that use proper MVC principles to compartmentailze code.

## Dependencies
    All required packages are listed in the included package.json file. Simply run "npm install" in the terminal to install all of the required packages.
