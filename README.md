# Wellness-App
This app allows a user to track a weekly meal plan as well as a weekly workout plan. 

## Why?
We created this application to demonstrate and practice full-stack web development. We wanted to include a polished UI, multiple API routes, and a 3rd party NPM package that we hadn't used before. We settled on using Passport to handle login functionality.


## How does it work?
Our app uses a database to keep track of users, their meal plans, and their workout plans. This data is then populated dynamically using handlebars files to create a page that's unique to each user.
